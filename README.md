# Virtual-Assistants-in-Families
On this website, you can find the companion material for the paper "Virtual Assistants in Families. A Cross-Sectional Online-Survey Study to Understand Families’ Decisions to Use Virtual Assistants in the Home." This paper reports on the first study conducted as part of project Rosie using the following research question for guidance: *How do individual differences between families influence their decision to (1) adopt and (2) continue using virtual assistants in their home?*
This website is produced directly from the project’s github repository. 

## About Project Rosie
[Project Rosie](https://www.uva.nl/en/shared-content/faculteiten/en/faculteit-der-maatschappij-en-gedragswetenschappen/news/2020/05/in-rosie-we-trust%E2%80%A6how-are-families-using-virtual-assistants.html) is set to study in depth how families with young children (aged 3 - 8 years) adopt, use, and eventually trust virtual assistants that are installed on smart speakers, like Google Home Nest or Amazon Echo, in their home. 

## Preregistration
[Here](https://osf.io/pmwud/?view_only=aaa1b70f0f75468388c8f50e2fed508f) you can find the prergistratration plans for the two surveys that form the first part of project Rosie looking into families' individual characteristics that potentially influence their decision (not) to adopt and continue using a vitual assistant in their home.

## Analyses
In what follows, you can find the analysis steps and respective R code that was used to answer the research question. Since this study holds datasets of two related but different surveys, the same set of analyses, if not mentioned otherwise, was performed on both datasets separately.
